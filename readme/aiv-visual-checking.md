# ðŸ¤– AIV Visual Checking

## Solution Design

The target of the project is to develop and deploy the object detection algorithm which enables the AIVs to conduct automated stock checking of approx. 20-30 shelves in the production area. Although the shelves and part boxes are standardized, there are some constraints that need to be taken into consideration. Namely;

\-Light condition may differ depending on the location of shelves

\-Distance between the camera and shelf may differ depending on the shelf

### 1. Data Collection & Image Process

* Capture the images from Camera on the trucks
* Take x frames per seconds to process at Pixel level

### 2. Predict the lane path

* Find the lane lines (pixels)
* Create a model to predict the path
* Exceptional case handling (light condition ;  weather ; sharp turn)

### 3. Data Process & Calculation&#x20;

* Define key parameters (center of lane, camera angles, thresholds of deviation, position the truck)
* Trigger the signal to stop the vehicles (integration)

### 4. Continous improvement

* Model update
* Reinforcement training
